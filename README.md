SenseGlove provides a C# API and a native C++ API which allow for low-level access to the SenseGlove’s sensor data and haptic motors. A communications library, SGConnect, is responsible for establishing communication with SenseGlove devices, while the SenseGlove Core Library converts raw data into usable formats. A separate program, SenseCom, uses the SGConnect library to communicate with your gloves and handles the calibration and firmware updates. 
A wrapper for the low-level C# API with conversion to Unity’s coordinate system and classes. You can work on the same level as the C++ / C# API, with direct control over the SenseGlove haptic motors and sensors.
Building onto this, the Unity Plugin supports hand model animation, components that add haptics to your projects, and a way to translate hand motion and collision into “Grabbing and Releasing”
